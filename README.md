# Plant_genome_assembly
BOSS mini project on plant genome assembly

## Description
Aim:

The study uses several genomic and bioinformatics approaches. In this project, participants will be required to reproduce the genomic analysis carried out in the study. The data will be available from NCBI. You are expected to: Download the sequence data programmatically, carry out DNA sequence pre-processing and de novo assembly and perform genome annotation of the plant of interest.

The draft genomes of five agriculturally important African orphan crops. 8, 1–16. https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy152 

Objectives: Come with a detailed report answering the following:

Are you able to determine genome location associated with crucial agronomic traits?
Are you able to arrive at similar conclusions as those in the paper? Why or why not?
Are the descriptions in the methodology section detailed for reproducibility? If not, what could you have done to improve reproducibility?
